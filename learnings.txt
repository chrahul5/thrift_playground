There's so little documentation on how to properly build and use Apache thrift.

A couple of difficulties I faced while building the basic thrift tutorial project,

https://github.com/cdmeister/Basic-Thrift-Tutorial

1. Thrift installation didn't work for kotelin but that is fine. (I only needed it for cpp)

2. I don't know what boost is, maybe it wasn't installed in my system. I had to replace 
   boost::shared_ptr with std::shared_ptr

3. To run the compiled server and client exec, I had to export an env variable

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:/usr/local/lib
